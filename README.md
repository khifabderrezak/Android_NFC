# elderFallDetection
##This application doesn't use the neural network yet, but it's based on fall caracteristics.
 It is based on a maximum threshold of the accelerometer that has been defined after several tests.
 If after this peak of the accelerometer there is no more movement for a few seconds, we determine that it is a
 fall and the application sends a message with the location of the victim.
